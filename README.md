## Getting Started

To run Job-Tube locally, follow these instructions. You will need both the frontend and backend repositories.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (LTS version recommended)
* npm (comes with Node.js) or Yarn
* A MongoDB database (e.g., a free tier cluster on [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas))

### Installation (Frontend)

1.  **Clone the frontend repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SahilSahu731/Job_tube/frontend
    cd frontend
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install # or yarn install
    ```
3.  **Create a `.env` file** in the root of the frontend directory and add your backend API URL. Make sure it points to your deployed backend or your local backend if running locally:
    ```
    VITE_APP_API_URL=[https://job-tube-api.onrender.com/api/v1](https://job-tube-api.onrender.com/api/v1)
    # For local development: REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api/v1
    ```
    *(This `REACT_APP_API_URL` should correctly match the base path you use in your Axios instance on the frontend, which typically includes the `/api/v1` prefix.)*
4.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start # or yarn start
    ```
    The frontend application will typically open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Installation (Backend)

1.  **Clone the backend repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SahilSahu731/Job_tube/backend
    cd backend
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install # or yarn install
    ```
3.  **Create a `.env` file** in the root of the backend directory and configure your environment variables:
    ```
    PORT=5000
    MONGO_URI=[Your MongoDB Atlas Connection String - e.g., mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster.mongodb.net/jobtube?retryWrites=true&w=majority]
    JWT_SECRET=[A strong, random secret string for JWT signing]
    FRONTEND_URL=[https://job-tube.onrender.com](https://job-tube.onrender.com) # Your deployed frontend URL for CORS
    ```
    * **MongoDB Atlas Connection String:** Obtain this from your MongoDB Atlas dashboard.
    * **JWT_SECRET:** Generate a long, complex, random string (e.g., using `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"` in your terminal).
4.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev # Or use 'node server.js' if you don't have a dev script
    ```
    The backend API server will typically run on `http://localhost:5000`.
